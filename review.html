        <h3>My Review of Software Engineering 1A</h3>
        <h5 id="date">January 27, 2019</h5>
        <p>
          <br />
          This review is a bit late, since as of now it has already been a
          couple weeks into second semester! Nevertheless, better late than
          never (something that I've been saying to myself a lot over the
          semester). <br />
          <br />
          I'll start off by reviewing the courses that I took this semester:
          <br /><br />
          <strong>CS 137:</strong> Welcome to introduction to programming in C!
          We learned about basic data structures as well as some important
          topics such as PageRank, Big O-Notation, and Linked Lists towards the
          end. Overall, this course was pretty nice and chill. <br /><br />
          <strong>MATH 115:</strong> This was our linear algebra course. I
          actually really enjoyed this course! Something to note is that
          depending on where you went to high school, either a lot of it will be
          review or it will all be totally brand new. <br /><br />
          <strong>MATH 135:</strong> For a lot of people (including me) this was
          our first introduction to proofs. I found this course to be very
          challenging at first, but I slowly got used to it. My advice: even
          though the assignments are difficult, try to do them by yourselves! I
          used to spend my entire Saturday every week working on the assignment.
          It paid off.<br /><br />
          <strong>MATH 117:</strong> Beware! This Calculus course starts off
          pretty slow, and is mostly review from high school. But it definitely
          picks up a bit in second semester and let's just say that the exam is
          something that you really need to study for<br /><br />
          <strong>ECE 105:</strong> This introduction to classical mechanics
          course was definitely the most challenging course of first semester.
          I'm not sure if a course like this is really neccesary for Software
          and ECE students but at least it teaches you how to study!
          <br /><br />
          Overall, I'd say that there definitely was a big jump from high school
          to university. I used to think that I had great study habits in high
          school, but I quickly discovered that I don't. The general strategy
          that I used in high school was to spend 2 days before a test doing
          nothing but that subject. I realized quickly within my first couple of
          weeks that <br />
          <strong>1: </strong> I simply didn't have enough time to do this! I
          had to learn how to consistently study so that I wouldn't be cramming
          for 2 whole days. <br />
          <strong>2: </strong> The tests and quizzes were generally more
          difficult and tested on stuff not explicitly taught in class.<br />
          To be honest, I still haven't gotten the hang of properly studying,
          but I did realize that it's a good idea to make sure I understood what
          each day's lecture was about by the end of the day, or at max: the end
          of the next day. Memorizing could come later, but general
          understanding had to be prioritized.<br /><br />
          Emotionally, the transition was tough on me. I was not used to doing
          poorly on quizzes and imposter syndrome hit me hard. For the first
          month or so, I thought that I was completely alone in this. Everyone
          else seemed fine. But I soon realized that imposter syndrome affects
          so many of us, and none of us are completely sure of anything. I also
          learned that in general, my fellow students love to help others. If I
          got stuck on something I could always ask my friends for help. <br />
          <br />
          All in all, the transition was more difficult than I had anticipated
          but I still had a great time in 1A making friends and memories that
          will last for a lifetime.<br /><br />
